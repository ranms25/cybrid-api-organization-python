Hi Gabor,

 How are you?

After many efforts, I was able to find a project that github action will do well and I believe it will help.
I would appreciate your approval before sending to PR.

This is content that I think is important to attach to the aforementioned PR:

This YAML file sets up continuous integration for your project, allowing for automated testing and deployment. 
The code is automatically checked whenever there is a push, pull request, or manual trigger. 
This ensures that your code is always tested on a variety of operating systems and Python versions, giving you confidence that your code is functioning properly.
This will save time and effort in the long run and help identify and fix bugs quickly and efficiently.
